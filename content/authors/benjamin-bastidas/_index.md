I’ve always been interested in science and mathematics and I try to apply these to everything I do in my life. I also love programming, and everything related to the study of the universe, from amateur astrophotography to astrophysics.

Currently, I’m a Research Engineer at Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, were I work developing and implementing solutions to solar energy/power control and management based on stochastic optimization models. I also have previous experience working in consulting related to operations research and software development.
